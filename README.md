# Professional Programming

> Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. (Abraham Lincoln)

A collection of full-stack resources for programmers.

The goal of this page is to make you a more proficient developer. You'll find only resources that I've found truly inspiring, or that have become timeless classics.

This page is not meant to be comprehensive. I am trying to keep it light and not too overwhelming. The selection of articles is opinionated.

## Contributing to this list

Feel free to open a PR to contribute! I will not be adding everything: as stated above, I am trying to keep the list concise.

## Must-read books

I've found these books incredibly inspiring:

* [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to
  Master](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X) 📖: hands-on the most inspiring and useful book I've read about programming.
* [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software
  Construction](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670) 📖: a nice addition to The Pragmatic Programmer, gives you the necessary framework to talk about code.
* [Release It!](https://smile.amazon.com/Release-Design-Deploy-Production-Ready-Software/dp/1680502395) 📖: this books goes beyond code and gives you best practices for building production-ready software. It will give you about 3 years worth of real-world experience.
* [Scalability Rules: 50 Principles for Scaling Web
  Sites](https://smile.amazon.com/Scalability-Rules-Principles-Scaling-Sites/dp/013443160X) 📖
* [The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/The-Linux-Programming-Interface-Handbook/dp/1593272200) 📖: outside of teaching you almost everything you need to know about Linux, this book will give you insights into how software evolves, and the value of having simple & elegant interfaces.

There are some free books available, including:

* [Professional software development](http://mixmastamyk.bitbucket.io/pro_soft_dev/) 📖: pretty complete and a good companion to this page. The free chapters are mostly focused on software development processes: design, testing, code writing, etc. - and not so much about tech itself.
* [List of free programming books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books)

## Must-read articles

* [Practical Advice for New Software Engineers](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/practical-advice-for-new-software-engineers)
* [On Being A Senior Engineer](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)
* [Lessons Learned in Software Development](http://henrikwarne.com/2015/04/16/lessons-learned-in-software-development/): one of those articles that give you years of hard-earned lessons, all in one short article. Must read.
* [Signs that you're a good programmer](http://www.yacoset.com/Home/signs-that-you-re-a-good-programmer)
* [Signs that you're a bad programmer](http://www.yacoset.com/Home/signs-that-you-re-a-bad-programmer)

## Other general material and list of resources

* [The Imposter's Handbook](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook) - $30. From the author: "Don't have a CS Degree? Neither do I - That's why I wrote this book."

* If you're working on data, Edward Tufte's [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458046603&sr=8-1&keywords=tufte) is considered a classic.
* The [Universal Principles of Design](http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458046663&sr=8-1&keywords=universal+principles+of+design) will give you enough vocabulary and concepts to describe design challenges into words.
* [Microsoft's Rest API guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md)
* [Book recommendations from HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12711060)

### Design (OO modeling, architecture, patterns, anti-patterns, etc.)

Here's a list of good books:

* [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201633612/): dubbed "the gang of four", this is almost a required reading for any developer. A lot of those are a bit overkill for Python (because everything is an object, and dynamic typing), but the main idea (composition is better than inheritance) definitely is a good philosophy.
* [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321127420/?tag=stackoverfl08-20): learn about how database are used in real world applications. Mike Bayer's SQLAlchemy has been heavily influenced by this book.
* [Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) 📖, Eric Evans
* [Clean Architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18043011-clean-architecture) 📖, Robert C. Martin. Uncle Bob proposes an architecture that leverages the Single Responsibility Principle to its fullest. A great way to start a new codebase. Also checkout the [clean architecture cheatsheet](cheatsheets/Clean-Architecture-V1.0.pdf).

Articles:

* [101 Design Patterns & Tips for Developers](https://sourcemaking.com/design-patterns-and-tips)

[Another slightly longer one here](http://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Object_Oriented_Programming.html). [One last one, in Python 3](http://blog.thedigitalcatonline.com/blog/2014/08/20/python-3-oop-part-3-delegation-composition-and-inheritance/#.V7SZ4tB96Rs).
* [Composition Instead Of Inheritance](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CompositionInsteadOfInheritance)
* [Complexity and Strategy](https://hackernoon.com/complexity-and-strategy-325cd7f59a92): interesting perspective on complexity and flexibility with really good examples (e.g. Google Apps Suite vs. Microsoft Office).

> You can use an eraser on the drafting table or a sledge hammer on the construction site. (Frank Lloyd Wright)

#### Design: simplicity

* [Simple Made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) 🎞, Rich Hickey. This is an incredibly inspiring talk redefining simplicity, ease and complexity, and showing that solutions that look easy may actually harm your design.

Richard Feynman's Learning Strategy:

1. Step 1: Continually ask "Why?”
2. Step 2: When you learn something, learn it to where you can explain it to a child.
3. Step 3: Instead of arbitrarily memorizing things, look for the explanation that makes it obvious.

### Problem solving

### Project management

See [Project management section on my engineering-management list of resources](https://github.com/charlax/engineering-management#project-management).

### Programming languages

I would recommend learning:

* JavaScript and maybe another interpreted language (Python, Ruby, etc.). Interpreted languages are useful for quick one-off automation scripts, and fastest to write for interviews. JavaScript is ubiquitous.
* A compiled language (Java, C, C++...).
* A more recent language to see where the industry is going (as of writing, Go, Swift, Rust, Elixir...).
* A language that has first-class support for functional programming (Haskell, Scala, Clojure...).

#### Python

For Python feel free to checkout my [professional Python education repository](https://github.com/charlax/python-education).

#### JavaScript

JavaScript is such a pervasive language that it's almost required learning.
