# Professional Programming - about this list

> Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. (Abraham Lincoln)

A collection of full-stack resources for programmers.

The goal of this page is to make you a more proficient developer. You'll find only resources that I've found truly inspiring, or that have become timeless classics.

## Principles

- This page is not meant to be comprehensive. I am trying to keep it light and not too overwhelming.
- The selection of articles is opinionated.
- I don't necessarily agree with or endorse every single line that is written in every single one of those resources. The same applies to their authors: I don't endorse everything each of those authors has said and will ever say.

Items:

- 🧰 : list of resources
- 📖 : book
- 🎞 : video/movie extract/movie/talk
- 🏙 : slides/presentation
- ⭐️ : must-read
- 📃 : paper

## Contributing to this list

Feel free to open a PR to contribute!

I will not be adding everything: as stated above, I am trying to keep the list concise.

## Must-read books

I've found these books incredibly inspiring:

- 📖 [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/): hands-on the most inspiring and useful book I've read about programming.
- 📖 [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670): a nice addition to The Pragmatic Programmer, gives you the necessary framework to talk about code.
- 📖 [Release It!](https://smile.amazon.com/Release-Design-Deploy-Production-Ready-Software/dp/1680502395): this books goes beyond code and gives you best practices for building production-ready software. It will give you about 3 years worth of real-world experience.
- 📖 [Scalability Rules: 50 Principles for Scaling Web Sites](https://smile.amazon.com/Scalability-Rules-Principles-Scaling-Sites/dp/013443160X)
- 📖 [The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/The-Linux-Programming-Interface-Handbook/dp/1593272200): outside of teaching you almost everything you need to know about Linux, this book will give you insights into how software evolves, and the value of having simple & elegant interfaces.
- 📖 [Structure and interpretation of Computer Programs](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) (free): One of the most influential textbooks in Computer Science (written and used at MIT), SICP has been influential in CS education. [Byte](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)>) recommended SICP "for professional programmers who are really interested in their profession".

There are some free books available, including:

- 📖 [Professional software development](http://mixmastamyk.bitbucket.io/pro_soft_dev/): pretty complete and a good companion to this page. The free chapters are mostly focused on software development processes: design, testing, code writing, etc. - and not so much about tech itself.
- 🧰 [vhf/free-programming-books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books)
- 🧰 [EbookFoundation/free-programming-books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books.md)

  - Early in your career, you can learn 10x more in a supportive team in 1 year, than coding on your own
  - Every company has problems, every company has technical debt.
  - Being overly opinionated on topics you lack real-world experience with is pretty arrogant.
  - Many conference talks cover proof of concepts rather than real-world scenarios.
  - Dealing with legacy is completely normal.
  - Architecture is more important than nitpicking.
  - Focus on automation over documentation where appropriate.
  - Having some technical debt is healthy.
  - Senior engineers must develop many skills besides programming.
  - We’re all still junior in some areas.
- [How to Build Good Software](https://www.csc.gov.sg/articles/how-to-build-good-software)
  - A good high-level summary of fundamental engineering practices.
  - The root cause of bad software has less to do with specific engineering choices, and more to do with how development projects are managed.
  - There is no such thing as platonically good engineering: it depends on your needs and the practical problems you encounter.
  - Software should be treated not as a static product, but as a living manifestation of the development team’s collective understanding.
  - Software projects rarely fail because they are too small; they fail because they get too big.
  - Beware of bureaucratic goals masquerading as problem statements. If our end goal is to make citizens’ lives better, we need to explicitly acknowledge the things that are making their lives worse.
  - Building software is not about avoiding failure; it is about strategically failing as fast as possible to get the information you need to build something good.

### Axioms

- [Precepts - Urbit](https://urbit.org/blog/precepts/)
  - Data is better than code.
  - Correctness is more important than performance.
  - Deterministic beats heuristic.
  - One hundred lines of simplicity is better than twenty lines of complexity.
  - If your abstractions are leaking, it's not due to some law of the universe; you just suck at abstracting. Usually, you didn't specify the abstraction narrowly enough.
  - If you avoid changing a section of code for fear of awakening the demons therein, you are living in fear. If you stay in the comfortable confines of the small section of the code you wrote or know well, you will never write legendary code. All code was written by humans and can be mastered by humans.
  - If there's clearly a right way to do something and a wrong way, do it the right way. Coding requires incredible discipline.
  - The best way to get the right answer is to try it the wrong way.
  - Practice tells you that things are good or bad; theory tells you why.
  - Not being qualified to solve a problem is no reason not to solve it.
  - If you don't understand a system you're using, you don't control it. If nobody understands the system, the system is in control.

    - "Using links instead of foreign keys to express relationships in APIs reduces the amount of information a client needs to know to use an API, and reduces the ways in which clients and servers are coupled to each other."
- [Give me /events, not webhooks](https://blog.sequin.io/events-not-webhooks/)
  - Events can unlock much-needed webhook features, like allowing your webhook consumers to replay or reset the position of their webhook subscription.

  - In the triumvirate of software, product managers, designers, and software engineers, only the engineers are expected to turn off their creative minds and just produce.
  - Both engineers and product managers tend to think, incorrectly, that product specifications or requirements are equivalent to the furniture manual from Ikea.
  - This is one of the top things that make engineers grumpy: constantly shifting priorities.
  - Even though many engineers will complain that product managers change their minds, almost none will account for that in their time estimates.
  - Computer science programs aren’t about preparing you for the tasks you’ll face in industry.
  - When there are more engineers than can be used, engineering time ends up going away from developing and towards planning, synchronization, and coordination.
  - Involve engineers in the creative process
  - Give engineers opportunities to be creative.
  - Encourage time off.
  - Let 'em code
  - Express appreciation
- [The Product-Minded Software Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/), Gergely Orosz
  - Great product engineers know that minimum lovable products need the right depth
  - Product-minded engineers quickly map out edge cases and think of ways to reduce work on them: often bringing solutions that require no engineering work
  - Engage in user research and customer support
  - Bring well-backed product suggestions to the table
  - Offer product/engineering tradeoffs
- [40 Lessons From 40 Years](https://medium.com/@schlaf/40-lessons-from-40-years-de39d2c622d6), Steve Schlafman
  - If you want to make progress on the things that matter most, you need to decide who you’re going to disappoint. It’s inevitable.
  - The best investment you can make is your own education. Never stop learning. The second best investment you can make is building your network through authentic and meaningful interactions. It is what you know and who you know.
  - You’ll never get what you don’t ask for or actively seek out. Go for it!
  - It’s not about the light at the end of the tunnel. It’s the tunnel. Show up every day and enjoy the process.
  - A great teammate always puts the organization and its purpose ahead of their own self interests.
  - Pick your spots. We have limited time and our brains can only process so much. Focus is key. Choose wisely.
  - Every person is likely struggling with something. Be kind. Be helpful.
- [On Coding, Ego and Attention](https://josebrowne.com/on-coding-ego-and-attention/)
  - Beginner’s mind accepts the fact that absolute knowledge is infinite and thus keeping score is a waste of time.
  - Mastery is simply the accumulation of momentum, not the accumulation of knowledge.
  - Dealing with ego distraction has taught me to love the problem solving process. It’s taught me to love and respect the learning process. As a result I’m more productive. I’m less anxious. I’m a better teammate. I’m a better friend and a better thinker.

> Imposter syndrome is underrated: a lot of talk goes into overcoming imposter syndrome. I say embrace self-skepticism and doubt yourself every day. In a fast-moving industry where lots of your knowledge expires every year, even the most junior people around you constantly cook up skills you don't have; you stay competitive by applying with the determination (and even fear) of the novice. The upside of this treadmill is that every engineer is on it: just because you're an imposter doesn't mean that other people are more deserving than you, because they're imposters too. You should advocate for yourself, take risks, pat yourself on the back when things go well, and, as you start to build a track record of solving problems, trust your skills and adaptability. Just make no mistake: you're only as good as the last problem you solve.

### Design (visual, UX, UI, typography)

I highly recommend reading [The Non-Designer's Design Book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0133966151/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687602&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0321534042&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1R7MVQP0BCP7GP9VZGYX). This is a pretty short book that will give you some very actionable design advices.

- If you're working on data, Edward Tufte's [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458046603&sr=8-1&keywords=tufte) is considered a classic.
- The [Universal Principles of Design](http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458046663&sr=8-1&keywords=universal+principles+of+design) will give you enough vocabulary and concepts to describe design challenges into words.

### Design (OO modeling, architecture, patterns, anti-patterns, etc.)

Here's a list of good books:

- 📖 [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201633612/): dubbed "the gang of four", this is almost a required reading for any developer. A lot of those are a bit overkill for Python (because everything is an object, and dynamic typing), but the main idea (composition is better than inheritance) definitely is a good philosophy.
  - And their nefarious nemesis [Resign Patterns](http://nishitalab.org/user/paulo/files/resign-patterns.txt)
- 📖 [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321127420/?tag=stackoverfl08-20): learn about how database are used in real world applications. Mike Bayer's SQLAlchemy has been heavily influenced by this book.
- 📖 [Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215), Eric Evans
- 📖 [Clean Architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18043011-clean-architecture), Robert C. Martin. Uncle Bob proposes an architecture that leverages the Single Responsibility Principle to its fullest. A great way to start a new codebase. Also checkout the [clean architecture cheatsheet](cheatsheets/Clean-Architecture-V1.0.pdf) and [this article](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
- 📖 [Game Programming Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0990582906/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_9xygFb9M86CXY): a book about design, sequencing, behavioral patterns and much more by Robert Nystrom explained through the medium of game programming.

- [OO vs FP](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/11/24/FPvsOO.html), Robert C. Martin, The Clean Code Blog. A pretty interesting take on the differences between OOP and FP from an expert in OOP.
  - OO is not about state. Objects are bags of functions, not bags of data.
  - Functional Programs, like OO Programs, are composed of functions that operate on data.
  - FP imposes discipline upon assignment.
  - OO imposes discipline on function pointers.
  - The principles of software design still apply, regardless of your programming style. The fact that you’ve decided to use a language that doesn’t have an assignment operator does not mean that you can ignore the Single Responsibility Principle.
- [Parse, don’t validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)
  - Use a data structure that makes illegal states unrepresentable
  - Push the burden of proof upward as far as possible, but no further
  - Let your datatypes inform your code, don’t let your code control your datatypes
  - Don’t be afraid to parse data in multiple passes
  - Avoid denormalized representations of data, especially if it’s mutable
  - Use abstract datatypes to make validators “look like” parsers

### Incident response (oncall, alerting, outages, firefighting, postmortem)

- [Incident Response at Heroku](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/5/9/incident-response-at-heroku)
  - Described the Incident Commander role, inspired by natural disaster incident response.
  - Also in presentation: [Incident Response Patterns: What we have learned at PagerDuty - Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/arupchak/incident-response-patterns-what-we-have-learned-at-pagerduty)
- [My Philosophy On Alerting](https://linuxczar.net/sysadmin/philosophy-on-alerting/)
  - Pages should be urgent, important, actionable, and real.
  - Err on the side of removing noisy alerts – over-monitoring is a harder problem to solve than under-monitoring.
  - Symptoms are a better way to capture more problems more comprehensively and robustly with less effort.
  - Include cause-based information in symptom-based pages or on dashboards, but avoid alerting directly on causes.
  - The further up your serving stack you go, the more distinct problems you catch in a single rule. But don’t go so far you can’t sufficiently distinguish what’s going on.
  - If you want a quiet oncall rotation, it’s imperative to have a system for dealing with things that need timely response, but are not imminently critical.
  - This classical article has now become a [chapter](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/) in Google's SRE book.
- The Google SRE book's [chapter about oncall](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/on-call/)
- [Writing Runbook Documentation When You’re An SRE](https://www.transposit.com/blog/2020.01.30-writing-runbook-documentation-when-youre-an-sre/)
  - Playbooks “reduce stress, the mean time to repair (MTTR), and the risk of human error.”
  - Using a template can be beneficial because starting from a blank document is incredibly hard.
  - The Curse of Knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when someone is communicating with others and unknowingly assumes the level of knowledge of the people they are communicating with.
  - Make your content easy to glance over.
  - If a script is longer than a single line, treat it like code, and check it into a repository to be source control and potentially tested.

#### Postmortem

- A great example of a [postmortem from Gitlab (01/31/2017)](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/) for an outage during which an engineer's action caused the irremediable loss of 6 hours of data.

  - "As a medium, books are surprisingly bad at conveying knowledge, and readers mostly don’t realize it."
  - "In learning sciences, we call this model “transmissionism.” It’s the notion that knowledge can be directly transmitted from teacher to student, like transcribing text from one page onto another. If only!"
  - "By re-testing yourself on material you’ve learned over expanding intervals, you can cheaply and reliably commit huge volumes of information to long-term memory."

  - Don't add things you don't understand.
  - Don't add cards memorizing entire lists.
  - Write it out. For wrong answers, I'll write it on paper. The act of writing is meditative. I really enjoy this.
  - Keep on asking yourself why? why does this work? why does it work this way? Force yourself to understand the root of a topic.
  - Cornell Method: when reading a topic, write out questions on the margins to quiz yourself.
  - Pretend you have to teach it
  - Use mnemonics phrases like PEMDAS for lists and other hard-to-remember topics.
  - Delete cards that don't make sense or you don't want to remember anymore.
- [Effective learning: Twenty rules of formulating knowledge](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules)

  - Cloze deletion is easy and effective: Kaleida's mission was to create a ... It finally produced one, called Script X. But it took three years
  - Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion
  - Avoid sets
  - Avoid enumerations
  - Combat interference - even the simplest items can be completely intractable if they are similar to other items. Use examples, context cues, vivid illustrations, refer to emotions, and to your personal life
  - Personalize and provide examples - personalization might be the most effective way of building upon other memories. Your personal life is a gold mine of facts and events to refer to. As long as you build a collection for yourself, use personalization richly to build upon well established memories
  - Provide sources - sources help you manage the learning process, updating your knowledge, judging its reliability, or importance
  - Prioritize - effective learning is all about prioritizing.

Richard Feynman's Learning Strategy:

1. Step 1: Continually ask "Why?”
2. Step 2: When you learn something, learn it to where you can explain it to a child.
3. Step 3: Instead of arbitrarily memorizing things, look for the explanation that makes it obvious.

### Observability (monitoring, logging, exception handling)

#### Logging

- [Do not log](https://sobolevn.me/2020/03/do-not-log) dwells on some logging antipatterns.
  - Logging does not make much sense in monitoring and error tracking. Use better tools instead: error and business monitorings with alerts, versioning, event sourcing.
  - Logging adds significant complexity to your architecture. And it requires more testing. Use architecture patterns that will make logging an explicit part of your contracts
  - Logging is a whole infrastructure subsystem on its own. And quite a complex one. You will have to maintain it or to outsource this job to existing logging services
- [Lies My Parents Told Me (About Logs)](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/lies-my-parents-told-me-about-logs/)
    - Logs are cheap
    - I can run it better myself
    - Leveled logging is a great way to separate information
    - Logs are basically the same as events
    - A standard logging format is good enough

- [Don’t Let Architecture Astronauts Scare You](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/), Joel
  - Sometimes smart thinkers just don’t know when to stop, and they create these absurd, all-encompassing, high-level pictures of the universe that are all good and fine, but don’t actually mean anything at all.
  - Your typical architecture astronaut will take a fact like “Napster is a peer-to-peer service for downloading music” and ignore everything but the architecture, thinking it’s interesting because it’s peer to peer, completely missing the point that it’s interesting because you can type the name of a song and listen to it right away.

> “A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.”

— John Gall, General systemantics, an essay on how systems work, and especially how they fail..., 1975 (this quote is sometime referred as "Galls' law")

> "Software engineering is what happens to programming when you add time and other programmers."

— Rob Pike, [Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering](https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article)

> You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

— Steve Jobs

  - Third, it’s important to let yourself be vulnerable and connect to others.
  - Fourth, do something for others.
  - Fifth, protect the planet.

### Project management

See the [Project management section on my engineering-management list of resources](https://github.com/charlax/engineering-management#project-management).

### Programming languages

I would recommend learning:

- JavaScript and maybe another interpreted language (Python, Ruby, etc.). Interpreted languages are useful for quick one-off automation scripts, and fastest to write for interviews. JavaScript is ubiquitous.
- A compiled language (Java, C, C++...).
  - [Learn c in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c/)
- A more recent language to see where the industry is going (as of writing, Go, Swift, Rust, Elixir...).
- A language that has first-class support for functional programming (Haskell, Scala, Clojure...).

  - These new perspectives, these ideas and patterns — they linger, they stay with you, even if you end up in another language. And that is powerful enough to keep on learning new languages, because one of the best things that can happen to you when you’re trying to solve a problem is a change of perspective.

  - It is three times as difficult to build reusable components as single use components.
  - A reusable component should be tried out in three different applications before it will be sufficiently general to accept into a reuse library.

- [Feature Toggles (aka Feature Flags)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html), Pete Hodgson, martinFowler.com. Comprehensive article on the topic.
  - Deliver new functionality to users rapidly but safely
  - Release Toggles allow incomplete and un-tested codepaths to be shipped to production as latent code which may never be turned on.
  - Experiment Toggles are used to perform multivariate or A/B testing.
  - Ops Toggles control operational aspects of our system's behavior.
  - Permissioning Toggles change the features or product experience that certain users receive.
  - Static vs dynamic toggles
  - Long-lived toggles vs transient toggles
  - Savvy teams view their Feature Toggles as inventory which comes with a carrying cost, and work to keep that inventory as low as possible.

- [Developing in Production](https://tersesystems.com/blog/2020/01/22/developing-in-production/)
  - Complex systems have emergent behavior, producing epiphenomenon that only appears with sufficient scale.
  - Wood's theorem: As the complexity of a system increases, the accuracy of any single agent’s own model of that system decreases rapidly.
  - The more tools and code that you add to create elements in a system, the harder it is to replicate an environment encompassing those tools and code.
  - At the core of testing in production is the idea of splitting deployments (of artifacts) from releases (of features).
- [Testing in Production: the hard parts](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/testing-in-production-the-hard-parts-3f06cefaf592), Cindy Sridharan
  - The whole point of [actual] distributed systems engineering is you assume you’re going to fail at some point in time and you design the system in such a way that the damage, at each point is minimized, that recovery is quick, and that the risk is acceptably balanced with cost.
  - How can you cut the blast radius for a similar event in half?
    - Differentiate between deployment (0 risk) and release
    - Build a deploy-observe-release pipeline
    - Make incremental rollouts the norm (canaries, %-based rollouts, etc.)
    - Test configuration changes just like you test code
    - Default to roll back, avoid fixing forward (slow!)
    - Eliminate gray failures - prefer crashing to degrading in certain cases
    - Prefer loosely coupled services at the expense of latency or correctness
    - Use poison tasters (isolate handling of client input)

- [Meaningful availability](https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/02/26/meaningful-availability/)
  - A good availability metric should be meaningful, proportional, and actionable. By "meaningful" we mean that it should capture what users experience. By "proportional" we mean that a change in the metric should be proportional to the change in user-perceived availability. By "actionable" we mean that the metric should give system owners insight into why availability for a period was low. This paper shows that none of the commonly used metrics satisfy these requirements…

- [Fixing Technical Debt with an Engineering Allocation Framework](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16WU1cxG02jnVGQ5byviw3_Q0ILDPZPYtTvU91_210T0/edit#slide=id.p)

    - Communicate the business value
- [Ur-Technical Debt](https://www.georgefairbanks.com/ieee-software-v32-n4-july-2020-ur-technical-debt)
    - Today, any code that a developer dislikes is branded as technical debt.
    - Ward Cunningham invented the debt metaphor to explain to his manager that building iteratively gave them working code faster, much like borrowing money to start a project, but that it was essential to keep paying down the debt, otherwise the interest payments would grind the project to a halt.
    - Ur-technical debt is generally not detectable by static analysis.

### Testing

- ⭐️ [Testing strategies in a microservices architecture](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/) (Martin Fowler) is an awesome resources explaining how to test a service properly.

Why test:

- [Why bother writing tests at all?](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/14/why-bother-writing-tests-at-all), Dave Cheney. A good intro to the topic.
  - Even if you don’t, someone will test your software
  - The majority of testing should be performed by development teams
  - Manual testing should not be the majority of your testing because manual testing is O(n)
  - Tests are the critical component that ensure you can always ship your master branch
  - Tests lock in behaviour
  - Tests give you confidence to change someone else’s code

How to test:

- [A quick puzzle to test your problem solving](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/03/upshot/a-quick-puzzle-to-test-your-problem-solving.html?_r=0)... and a great way to learn about confirmation bias and why you're mostly writing positive test cases.
- [Testing is not for beginners](https://www.calhoun.io/testing-is-not-for-beginners/): why learning to test is hard. This shouldn't demotivate you though!

- [Test smarter, not harder](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/test-smarter-not-harder/)

Test pyramid:

- [The test pyramid](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html), Martin Fowler
- [Eradicating non-determinism in tests](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/nonDeterminism.html), Martin Fowler
- [The practical test pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html), MartinFowler.com
  - Be clear about the different types of tests that you want to write. Agree on the naming in your team and find consensus on the scope of each type of test.
  - Every single test in your test suite is additional baggage and doesn't come for free.
  - Test code is as important as production code.

- [It's time to start writing](https://alexnixon.github.io/2019/12/10/writing.html) explains why Jeff Bezos banned PowerPoint at Amazon.
  - The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than "writing" a 20 page powerpoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what's more important than what, and how things are related.
  - Powerpoint-style presentations somehow give permission to gloss over ideas, flatten out any sense of relative importance, and ignore the interconnectedness of ideas.

  - Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
  - Never use a long word where a short one will do.
  - If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
  - Never use the passive where you can use the active.
  - Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
  - Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
