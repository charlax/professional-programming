# Professional Programming

> Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. (Abraham Lincoln)

A collection of full-stack resources for programmers.

The goal of this page is to make you a more proficient developer. You'll find only resources that I've found truly inspiring, or that have been become timeless classics.

## Must read books

I've found these books incredibly inspiring:

* [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to
  Master](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X): hands-on the most inspiring and useful book I've read about programming.
* [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software
  Construction](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670): a nice addition to The Programatic Programmer, gives you the necessary framework to talk about code.
* [Release It!](http://www.amazon.com/Release-It-Production-Ready-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0978739213): this books goes beyond code and gives you best practices for building production-ready software. It will give you about 3 years worth of real-world experience.
* [Scalability Rules: 50 Principles for Scaling Web
  Sites](http://www.amazon.com/Scalability-Rules-Principles-Scaling-Sites/dp/0321753887)
* [The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/The-Linux-Programming-Interface-Handbook/dp/1593272200): outside of teaching you almost everything you need to know about Linux, this book will give you insights into how software evolves, and the value of having simple & elegant interfaces.

There are some free books available, including:

* [Professional software development](http://mixmastamyk.bitbucket.org/pro_soft_dev/): pretty complete and a good companion to this page. The free chapters are mostly focused on software development processes: design, testing, code writing, etc. - and not so much about tech itself.
* [List of free programming books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books)

## Must-read articles

* [Practical Advice for New Software Engineers](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/practical-advice-for-new-software-engineers)
* [On Being A Senior Engineer](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)
* [Lessons Learned in Software Development](http://henrikwarne.com/2015/04/16/lessons-learned-in-software-development/): one of those articles that give you years of hard-earned lessons, all in one short article. Must read.
* [Signs that you're a good programmer](http://www.yacoset.com/Home/signs-that-you-re-a-good-programmer)
* [Signs that you're a bad programmer](http://www.yacoset.com/Home/signs-that-you-re-a-bad-programmer)

## Other general material

* [The Imposter's Handbook](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook) - $30. From the author: "Don't have a CS Degree? Neither do I - That's why I wrote this book."

## Topics

### Algorithm and data structures

* Read the [CLRS](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms). You can watch and download the course on [OCW](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/) - there are newer courses as well.
* Or [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202?ie=UTF8&qid=1297127794&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1)
* Try out some algorithms on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

Let's be honest: algo can be a pretty dry topic. [This quora question](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-book-that-teaches-algorithms-data-structures-and-other-computer-science-basics-in-a-fun-way) lists some funnier learning alternative, including:

* [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617292230/ref=cm_sw_su_dp)
* [Essential Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Algorithms-Practical-Approach-Computer/dp/1118612108?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0)

### Attitude, habits, mindset

* [Mastering Programming](https://www.prod.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/mastering-programming/1184427814923414#), Kent Beck.
* [The traits of a proficient programmer](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-traits-of-a-proficient-programmer)

### Characters sets

* [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html)

### Coding

* [Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend](http://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to)
* [Lessons learned writing highly available code](https://medium.com/imgur-engineering/lessons-learned-writing-highly-available-code-7eaf3d7aae00#.u7c4j6hac)
* [The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/)

### Computer science

* [What every computer science major should know](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/)

### Databases

* [A plain english introduction to CAP Theorem](http://ksat.me/a-plain-english-introduction-to-cap-theorem/)
* [NOSQL Patterns](http://horicky.blogspot.nl/2009/11/nosql-patterns.html)
* [NoSQL Databases: a Survey and Decision Guidance](https://medium.baqend.com/nosql-databases-a-survey-and-decision-guidance-ea7823a822d#.9fe79qr90)
* [Safe Operations For High Volume PostgreSQL](https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/safe-operations-for-high-volume-postgresql/) (this is for PostgreSQL but works great for other db as well).
* [Zero downtime database migrations](https://blog.rainforestqa.com/2014-06-27-zero-downtime-database-migrations/) (code examples are using Rails but this works great for any programming language)

### Debugging

* [Rubber Duck Problem Solving](http://blog.codinghorror.com/rubber-duck-problem-solving/)
* [Rubber Ducking](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking)
* [Five Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys)
* [The Infinite Hows](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2014/11/14/the-infinite-hows-or-the-dangers-of-the-five-whys/): this provides a strong criticism of the five whys method.
* [Linux Performance Analysis in 60,000 Milliseconds](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/11/linux-performance-analysis-in-60s.html)

### Design (visual, UX, UI)

I highly recommend reading [The Non-Designer's Design Book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0133966151/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687602&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0321534042&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1R7MVQP0BCP7GP9VZGYX). This is a pretty short book that will give you some very actionable design advices.

* If you're working on data, Edward Tufte's [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458046603&sr=8-1&keywords=tufte) is considered a classic.
* The [Universal Principles of Design](http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458046663&sr=8-1&keywords=universal+principles+of+design) will give you enough vocabulary and concepts to describe design challenges into words.
* [Microsoft's Rest API guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md)

### Design patterns & anti-patterns (OOP)

Here's a list of good books:

* [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201633612/): dubbed "the gang of four", this is almost a required reading for any developer. A lot of those are a bit overkill for Python (because everything is an object, and dynamic typing), but the main idea (composition is better than inheritance) definitely is a good philosophy.
* [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321127420/?tag=stackoverfl08-20): learn about how database are used in real world applications. Mike Bayer's SQLAlchemy has been heavily influenced by this book.
* SourceMaking's [Design Patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns) seems to be a good web resource too.
* O'Reilly's [How to make mistakes in Python](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/how-to-make-mistakes-in-python.pdf)
* [101 Design Patterns & Tips for Developers](https://sourcemaking.com/design-patterns-and-tips)
* [Python Design Patterns: For Sleek And Fashionable Code](https://www.toptal.com/python/python-design-patterns): a pretty simple introduction to common design patterns (Facade, Adapter, Decorator). A more complete list of design patterns implementation in Python on [Github](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns). [Also a book here](http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PatternConcept.html).

I maintain a [list of antipatterns](https://github.com/charlax/antipatterns) on another repo. This is a highly recommended read.

* [Inheritance vs. composition](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex44.html): a concrete example in Python. [Another slightly longer one here](http://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Object_Oriented_Programming.html). [One last one, in Python 3](http://blog.thedigitalcatonline.com/blog/2014/08/20/python-3-oop-part-3-delegation-composition-and-inheritance/#.V7SZ4tB96Rs).
* [Composition Instead Of Inheritance](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CompositionInsteadOfInheritance)

### Programming language

This is language-specific, for instance, checkout my [professional Python education doc](https://github.com/charlax/python-education).

I'd recommend learning:

* At least one dynamic language (Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc.). Pretty useful for quick one-off automation scripts, and fastest to write for interviews.
* At least one compiled language (Java, C, C++, etc.)
* At least one more recent language to see where the industry is going (as of writing, Go, Swift, Rust, etc.)
* At least one language that has first-class support for functional programming (Haskell, Scala, etc.)
