# Professional Programming

> Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. (Abraham Lincoln)

A collection of full-stack resources for programmers.

## Must read books

I've found these books incredibly inspiring:

* [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to
  Master](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X): hands-on the most inspiring and useful book I've read about programming.
* [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software
  Construction](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670): a nice addition to The Programatic Programmer, gives you the necessary framework to talk about code.
* [Release It!](http://www.amazon.com/Release-It-Production-Ready-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0978739213): this books goes beyond code and gives you best practices for building production-ready software. It will give you about 3 years worth of real-world experience.
* [Scalability Rules: 50 Principles for Scaling Web
  Sites](http://www.amazon.com/Scalability-Rules-Principles-Scaling-Sites/dp/0321753887)
* [The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/The-Linux-Programming-Interface-Handbook/dp/1593272200): outside of teaching you almost everything you need to know about Linux, this book will give you insights into how software evolves, and the value of having simple & elegant interfaces. 

## Must-read articles

* [Practical Advice for New Software Engineers](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/practical-advice-for-new-software-engineers)
* [On Being A Senior Engineer](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)
* [Lessons Learned in Software Development](http://henrikwarne.com/2015/04/16/lessons-learned-in-software-development/): one of those articles that give you years of hard-earned lessons, all in one short article. Must read.

## Things to do

Resources

* [Bash Hackers Wiki](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/)
* [Master the command line, in one page](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) **must read**

### Know your dotfiles

* [Awesome dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles)

Articles

* [Setting Up a Mac Dev Machine From Zero to Hero With Dotfiles](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/setting-up-a-mac-dev-machine-from-zero-to-hero-with-dotfiles--net-35449)

### Know your git

* [Git Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/arslanbilal/git-cheat-sheet)
* [git-tips](https://github.com/git-tips/tips)

### Know how to debug

* [Rubber Duck Problem Solving](http://blog.codinghorror.com/rubber-duck-problem-solving/)
* [5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys)

### Know how to architect systems

* [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/): great blog about system architecture, its weekly review article are packed with numerous insights and interesting technology reviews.
* [6 Rules of thumb to build blazing fast web server applications](http://loige.co/6-rules-of-thumb-to-build-blazing-fast-web-applications/)

### Know your language

This is language-specific, for instance, checkout my [professional Python education doc](https://github.com/charlax/python-education).

### Know your design patterns and anti-patterns

Here's a list of good books:

* [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201633612/): dubbed "the gang of four", this is almost a required reading for any developer. A lot of those are a bit overkill for Python (because everything is an object, and dynamic typing), but the main idea (composition is better than inheritance) definitely is a good philosophy.
* [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321127420/?tag=stackoverfl08-20): learn about how database are used in real world applications. Mike Bayer's SQLAlchemy has been heavily influenced by this book.
* SourceMaking's [Design Patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns) seems to be a good web resource too.
* O'Reilly's [How to make mistakes in Python](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/how-to-make-mistakes-in-python.pdf)
  
I maintain a [list of antipatterns](https://github.com/charlax/antipatterns) on another repo. This is a highly recommended read.
