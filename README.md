# Professional Programming - about this list

> Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. (Abraham Lincoln)

A collection of full-stack resources for programmers.

The goal of this page is to make you a more proficient developer. You'll find only resources that I've found truly inspiring, or that have become timeless classics.

## Principles

- This page is not meant to be comprehensive. I am trying to keep it light and not too overwhelming.
- The selection of articles is opinionated.
- I don't necessarily agree with or endorse every single line that is written in every single one of those resources. The same applies to their authors: I don't endorse everything each of those authors has said and will ever say.

Items:

- üß∞ : list of resources
- üìñ : book
- üéû : video/movie extract/movie/talk
- üèô : slides/presentation
- ‚≠êÔ∏è : must-read
- üìÉ : paper

## Contributing to this list

Feel free to open a PR to contribute!

I will not be adding everything: as stated above, I am trying to keep the list concise.

## Must-read books

I've found these books incredibly inspiring:

- üìñ [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/): hands-on the most inspiring and useful book I've read about programming.
- üìñ [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670): a nice addition to The Pragmatic Programmer, gives you the necessary framework to talk about code.
- üìñ [Release It!](https://smile.amazon.com/Release-Design-Deploy-Production-Ready-Software/dp/1680502395): this books goes beyond code and gives you best practices for building production-ready software. It will give you about 3 years worth of real-world experience.
- üìñ [Scalability Rules: 50 Principles for Scaling Web Sites](https://smile.amazon.com/Scalability-Rules-Principles-Scaling-Sites/dp/013443160X)
- üìñ [The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/The-Linux-Programming-Interface-Handbook/dp/1593272200): outside of teaching you almost everything you need to know about Linux, this book will give you insights into how software evolves, and the value of having simple & elegant interfaces.
- üìñ [Structure and interpretation of Computer Programs](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) (free): One of the most influential textbooks in Computer Science (written and used at MIT), SICP has been influential in CS education. [Byte](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)>) recommended SICP "for professional programmers who are really interested in their profession".

There are some free books available, including:

- üìñ [Professional software development](http://mixmastamyk.bitbucket.io/pro_soft_dev/): pretty complete and a good companion to this page. The free chapters are mostly focused on software development processes: design, testing, code writing, etc. - and not so much about tech itself.
- üß∞ [vhf/free-programming-books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books)
- üß∞ [EbookFoundation/free-programming-books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/tree/main/books)

- [7 absolute truths I unlearned as junior developer](https://monicalent.com/blog/2019/06/03/absolute-truths-unlearned-as-junior-developer/)
  - Early in your career, you can learn 10x more in a supportive team in 1 year, than coding on your own
  - Every company has problems, every company has technical debt.
  - Being overly opinionated on topics you lack real-world experience with is pretty arrogant.
  - Many conference talks cover proof of concepts rather than real-world scenarios.
  - Dealing with legacy is completely normal.
  - Architecture is more important than nitpicking.
  - Focus on automation over documentation where appropriate.
  - Having some technical debt is healthy.
  - Senior engineers must develop many skills besides programming.
  - We‚Äôre all still junior in some areas.
- [How to Build Good Software](https://knowledge.csc.gov.sg/ethos-issue-21/how-to-build-good-software/)
  - A good high-level summary of fundamental engineering practices.
  - The root cause of bad software has less to do with specific engineering choices, and more to do with how development projects are managed.
  - There is no such thing as platonically good engineering: it depends on your needs and the practical problems you encounter.
  - Software should be treated not as a static product, but as a living manifestation of the development team‚Äôs collective understanding.
  - Software projects rarely fail because they are too small; they fail because they get too big.
  - Beware of bureaucratic goals masquerading as problem statements. If our end goal is to make citizens‚Äô lives better, we need to explicitly acknowledge the things that are making their lives worse.
  - Building software is not about avoiding failure; it is about strategically failing as fast as possible to get the information you need to build something good.
- [How to be a -10x Engineer](https://taylor.town/-10x)
  - Nullify the output of 10 engineers.

  - Assess the trade-off you‚Äôre making between quality and pace, make sure it‚Äôs appropriate for your context
  - Spending time sharpening the axe is almost always worth it
  - If you can‚Äôt easily explain why something is difficult, then it‚Äôs incidental complexity, which is probably worth addressing
  - Try to solve bugs one layer deeper
  - Don‚Äôt underestimate the value of digging into history to investigate some bugs
  - Bad code gives you feedback, perfect code doesn‚Äôt. Err on the side of writing bad code
  - Make debugging easier
  - When working on a team, you should usually ask the question
  - Shipping cadence matters a lot. Think hard about what will get you shipping quickly and often
- [Expert Generalists](https://martinfowler.com/articles/expert-generalist.html), martinfowler.com, proposes an interesting take on the "T-shaped engineer"
  - The Characteristics of an Expert Generalist: Curiosity, Collaborativeness, Customer Focus, Favor Fundamental Knowledge, Blend of Generalist and Specialist Skills, Sympathy for Related Domains
  - Assessing Expert Generalists: hiring and career progression
  - Growing Expert Generalists: From Tools to Fundamentals
    - "Why does our attention keep drifting toward tool expertise? It isn't because people are shortsighted or lazy; it's because the fundamentals are hard to see amid the noise."
  - Expert Generalists still need Specialists
  - Expert Generalists in the Age of LLMs
    - "Similarly to a specialist, an LLM can rapidly answer questions that an Expert Generalist will have when working in a new domain."
    - "Rather than looking for ‚Äúthe answer‚Äù, they prompt them to generate questions, explaining mechanisms, and providing examples and even tools that help explore the underlying mechanisms of an idea."

### Axioms

- [Precepts - Urbit](https://urbit.org/blog/precepts/)
  - Data is better than code.
  - Correctness is more important than performance.
  - Deterministic beats heuristic.
  - One hundred lines of simplicity is better than twenty lines of complexity.
  - If your abstractions are leaking, it's not due to some law of the universe; you just suck at abstracting. Usually, you didn't specify the abstraction narrowly enough.
  - If you avoid changing a section of code for fear of awakening the demons therein, you are living in fear. If you stay in the comfortable confines of the small section of the code you wrote or know well, you will never write legendary code. All code was written by humans and can be mastered by humans.
  - If there's clearly a right way to do something and a wrong way, do it the right way. Coding requires incredible discipline.
  - The best way to get the right answer is to try it the wrong way.
  - Practice tells you that things are good or bad; theory tells you why.
  - Not being qualified to solve a problem is no reason not to solve it.
  - If you don't understand a system you're using, you don't control it. If nobody understands the system, the system is in control.

### API design & development

General REST content:

- [Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm), Roy Fielding (the inventor of REST)
- [A collection of useful resources for building RESTful HTTP+JSON APIs.](https://github.com/yosriady/api-development-tools)
- [Best practices for REST API design](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/02/best-practices-for-rest-api-design/), Stack Overflow Blog
- üìñ [Undisturbed REST: a guide to designing the perfect API](https://www.mulesoft.com/sites/default/files/resource-assets/ebook-UndisturbedREST_v1.pdf): very complete book about RESTful API design.

Example guidelines:

- [Microsoft's Rest API guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md)
- [Zalando RESTful API and Event Scheme Guidelines](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/)
- [Google's API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/): a general guide to design networked API.
- [AIP-1: AIP Purpose and Guidelines](https://google.aip.dev/1)
  - AIP stands for API Improvement Proposal, which is a design document providing high-level, concise documentation for API development.

More specific topics:

- [Why you should use links, not keys, to represent relationships in APIs](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/api-design-why-you-should-use-links-not-keys-to-represent-relationships-in-apis), Martin Nally, Google
  - "Using links instead of foreign keys to express relationships in APIs reduces the amount of information a client needs to know to use an API, and reduces the ways in which clients and servers are coupled to each other."
- [Give me /events, not webhooks](https://blog.sequin.io/events-not-webhooks/)
  - Events can unlock much-needed webhook features, like allowing your webhook consumers to replay or reset the position of their webhook subscription.

  - In the triumvirate of software, product managers, designers, and software engineers, only the engineers are expected to turn off their creative minds and just produce.
  - Both engineers and product managers tend to think, incorrectly, that product specifications or requirements are equivalent to the furniture manual from Ikea.
  - This is one of the top things that make engineers grumpy: constantly shifting priorities.
  - Even though many engineers will complain that product managers change their minds, almost none will account for that in their time estimates.
  - Computer science programs aren‚Äôt about preparing you for the tasks you‚Äôll face in industry.
  - When there are more engineers than can be used, engineering time ends up going away from developing and towards planning, synchronization, and coordination.
  - Involve engineers in the creative process
  - Give engineers opportunities to be creative.
  - Encourage time off.
  - Let 'em code
  - Express appreciation
- [The Product-Minded Software Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/), Gergely Orosz
  - Great product engineers know that minimum lovable products need the right depth
  - Product-minded engineers quickly map out edge cases and think of ways to reduce work on them: often bringing solutions that require no engineering work
  - Engage in user research and customer support
  - Bring well-backed product suggestions to the table
  - Offer product/engineering tradeoffs
- [40 Lessons From 40 Years](https://medium.com/@schlaf/40-lessons-from-40-years-de39d2c622d6), Steve Schlafman
  - If you want to make progress on the things that matter most, you need to decide who you‚Äôre going to disappoint. It‚Äôs inevitable.
  - The best investment you can make is your own education. Never stop learning. The second best investment you can make is building your network through authentic and meaningful interactions. It is what you know and who you know.
  - You‚Äôll never get what you don‚Äôt ask for or actively seek out. Go for it!
  - It‚Äôs not about the light at the end of the tunnel. It‚Äôs the tunnel. Show up every day and enjoy the process.
  - A great teammate always puts the organization and its purpose ahead of their own self interests.
  - Pick your spots. We have limited time and our brains can only process so much. Focus is key. Choose wisely.
  - Every person is likely struggling with something. Be kind. Be helpful.
- [On Coding, Ego and Attention](https://josebrowne.com/on-coding-ego-and-attention/)
  - Beginner‚Äôs mind accepts the fact that absolute knowledge is infinite and thus keeping score is a waste of time.
  - Mastery is simply the accumulation of momentum, not the accumulation of knowledge.
  - Dealing with ego distraction has taught me to love the problem solving process. It‚Äôs taught me to love and respect the learning process. As a result I‚Äôm more productive. I‚Äôm less anxious. I‚Äôm a better teammate. I‚Äôm a better friend and a better thinker.

> Imposter syndrome is underrated: a lot of talk goes into overcoming imposter syndrome. I say embrace self-skepticism and doubt yourself every day. In a fast-moving industry where lots of your knowledge expires every year, even the most junior people around you constantly cook up skills you don't have; you stay competitive by applying with the determination (and even fear) of the novice. The upside of this treadmill is that every engineer is on it: just because you're an imposter doesn't mean that other people are more deserving than you, because they're imposters too. You should advocate for yourself, take risks, pat yourself on the back when things go well, and, as you start to build a track record of solving problems, trust your skills and adaptability. Just make no mistake: you're only as good as the last problem you solve.

- [Platform Engineering: Build vs Buy](https://kanenarraway.com/posts/platform-engineering-build-vs-buy/)

  - "The issue with the Five Whys is that it‚Äôs tunnel-visioned into a linear and simplistic explanation of how work gets done and events transpire."
  - "Human error becomes a starting point, not a conclusion." (Dekker, 2009)
  - "When we ask 'how?', we‚Äôre asking for a narrative."
  - "When it comes to decisions and actions, we want to know how it made sense for someone to do what they did."
  - At each "why" step, only one answer will be selected for further investigation. Asking "how" encourage broader exploration.
  - "In accident investigation, as in most other human endeavours, we fall prey to the What-You-Look-For-Is-What-You-Find or WYLFIWYF principle. This is a simple recognition of the fact that assumptions about what we are going to see (What-You-Look-For), to a large extent will determine what we actually find (What-You-Find)." (Hollnagel, 2009, p. 85) (see [illustration of WYLFIWYF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo))
  - "A final reason why a 'root cause' may be selected is that it is politically acceptable as the identified cause.

### Design (visual, UX, UI, typography)

I highly recommend reading [The Non-Designer's Design Book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0133966151/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687602&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0321534042&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1R7MVQP0BCP7GP9VZGYX). This is a pretty short book that will give you some very actionable design advices.

- If you're working on data, Edward Tufte's [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458046603&sr=8-1&keywords=tufte) is considered a classic.
- The [Universal Principles of Design](http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458046663&sr=8-1&keywords=universal+principles+of+design) will give you enough vocabulary and concepts to describe design challenges into words.

### Design (OO modeling, architecture, patterns, anti-patterns, etc.)

Here's a list of good books:

- üìñ [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201633612/): dubbed "the gang of four", this is almost a required reading for any developer. A lot of those are a bit overkill for Python (because everything is an object, and dynamic typing), but the main idea (composition is better than inheritance) definitely is a good philosophy.
  - And their nefarious nemesis [Resign Patterns](http://nishitalab.org/user/paulo/files/resign-patterns.txt)
- üìñ [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321127420/?tag=stackoverfl08-20): learn about how database are used in real world applications. Mike Bayer's SQLAlchemy has been heavily influenced by this book.
- üìñ [Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215), Eric Evans
- üìñ [Clean Architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18043011-clean-architecture), Robert C. Martin. Uncle Bob proposes an architecture that leverages the Single Responsibility Principle to its fullest. A great way to start a new codebase. Also checkout the [clean architecture cheatsheet](cheatsheets/Clean-Architecture-V1.0.pdf) and [this article](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
- üìñ [Game Programming Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0990582906/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_9xygFb9M86CXY): a book about design, sequencing, behavioral patterns and much more by Robert Nystrom explained through the medium of game programming. The book is also free to read online [here](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html).

- [No Silver Bullet - Essence and Accident in Software Engineering](https://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks_1986_-_No_Silver_Bullet.pdf), Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. (1986)
  - There are four properties of software systems which make building software hard: Complexity, Conformity, Changeability and Invisibility
  - There are ways to address this:
    - Exploiting the mass market to avoid constructing what can be bought. ("Buy vs. Build")
    - Using rapid prototyping as part of a planned iteration in establishing software requirements.
    - Growing software organically, adding more and more function to systems as they are run, used, and tested
    - Identifying and developing the great conceptual designers of the rising generation.
    - (also included in The Mythical Man-Month)
- [Out of the Tar Pit](https://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf), Ben Moseley, Peter Marks (2006) introduces the distinction between essential and accidental complexity
  - Complexity is the root cause of the vast majority of problems with software today. Unreliability, late delivery, lack of security ‚Äî often even poor performance in large-scale systems can all be seen as deriving ultimately from unmanageable complexity.
  - Quoting Djikstra: "testing is hopelessly inadequate....(it) can be used very effectively to show the presence of bugs but never to show their absence."
  - Functional programming goes a long way towards avoiding the problems of state-derived complexity, thanks to immutability and clear separation of state and logic.
- [A Note on Essential Complexity](https://olano.dev/blog/a-note-on-essential-complexity/)
  - The goal of the software engineer is to minimize accidental complexity and assist with essential complexity.
- [Software Design is Knowledge Building](https://olano.dev/blog/software-design-is-knowledge-building/)
  - Programming should be regarded as an activity by which the programmers form or achieve a certain kind of insight, a theory, of the matters at hand. This suggestion is in contrast to what appears to be a more common notion, that programming should be regarded as a production of a program and certain other texts.
  - The building of the program is the same as the building of the theory of it by the team of programmers.
- [Cognitive load is what matters](https://minds.md/zakirullin/cognitive#long)
  - A well-crafted monolith with truly isolated modules is often much more flexible than a bunch of microservices.
  - Three decades on, microkernel-based GNU Hurd is still in development, and monolithic Linux is everywhere
  - "Reduce cognitive load by limiting the number of choices." (Rob Pike)
  - The same rule applies to all sorts of numeric statuses (in the database or wherever) - prefer self-describing strings.
  - With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody. ([Hyrum's Law](https://www.hyrumslaw.com/))
  - DDD is about problem space, not about solution space.
  - Familiarity is not the same as simplicity
  - The more mental models there are to learn, the longer it takes for a new developer to deliver value.

> You can use an eraser on the drafting table or a sledge hammer on the construction site. (Frank Lloyd Wright)

- [OO vs FP](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/11/24/FPvsOO.html), Robert C. Martin, The Clean Code Blog. A pretty interesting take on the differences between OOP and FP from an expert in OOP.
  - OO is not about state. Objects are bags of functions, not bags of data.
  - Functional Programs, like OO Programs, are composed of functions that operate on data.
  - FP imposes discipline upon assignment.
  - OO imposes discipline on function pointers.
  - The principles of software design still apply, regardless of your programming style. The fact that you‚Äôve decided to use a language that doesn‚Äôt have an assignment operator does not mean that you can ignore the Single Responsibility Principle.
- [Parse, don‚Äôt validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)
  - Use a data structure that makes illegal states unrepresentable
  - Push the burden of proof upward as far as possible, but no further
  - Let your datatypes inform your code, don‚Äôt let your code control your datatypes
  - Don‚Äôt be afraid to parse data in multiple passes
  - Avoid denormalized representations of data, especially if it‚Äôs mutable
  - Use abstract datatypes to make validators ‚Äúlook like‚Äù parsers

### Incident response (oncall, alerting, outages, firefighting, postmortem)

Also see this section on my [list of management resources, "Incident response"](https://github.com/charlax/engineering-management/).

Also see the Debugging section in this doc.

- [Incident Response at Heroku](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/5/9/incident-response-at-heroku)
  - Described the Incident Commander role, inspired by natural disaster incident response.

  - Playbooks ‚Äúreduce stress, the mean time to repair (MTTR), and the risk of human error.‚Äù
  - Using a template can be beneficial because starting from a blank document is incredibly hard.
  - The Curse of Knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when someone is communicating with others and unknowingly assumes the level of knowledge of the people they are communicating with.
  - Make your content easy to glance over.
  - If a script is longer than a single line, treat it like code, and check it into a repository to be source control and potentially tested.

Alerting:

- [My Philosophy On Alerting](https://linuxczar.net/sysadmin/philosophy-on-alerting/)
  - Pages should be urgent, important, actionable, and real.
  - Err on the side of removing noisy alerts ‚Äì over-monitoring is a harder problem to solve than under-monitoring.
  - Symptoms are a better way to capture more problems more comprehensively and robustly with less effort.
  - Include cause-based information in symptom-based pages or on dashboards, but avoid alerting directly on causes.
  - The further up your serving stack you go, the more distinct problems you catch in a single rule. But don‚Äôt go so far you can‚Äôt sufficiently distinguish what‚Äôs going on.
  - If you want a quiet oncall rotation, it‚Äôs imperative to have a system for dealing with things that need timely response, but are not imminently critical.
  - This classical article has now become a [chapter](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/) in Google's SRE book.

#### Postmortem

- A great example of a [postmortem from Gitlab (01/31/2017)](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/) for an outage during which an engineer's action caused the irremediable loss of 6 hours of data.
- [Blameless PostMortems and a Just Culture](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/)
- [A list of postmortems on Github](https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems)
- Google's SRE book, [Postmortem chapter](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/postmortem-culture/) is excellent and includes many examples.
- [Human error models and management](https://app.box.com/s/7z35l09amvr1vwxouh2s)
  - High reliability organisations ‚Äî which have less than their fair share of accidents ‚Äî recognise that human variability is a force to harness in averting errors, but they work hard to focus that variability and are constantly preoccupied with the possibility of failure

> "Let‚Äôs plan for a future where we‚Äôre all as stupid as we are today."
>
> ‚Äì Dan Milstein

Example outline for a postmortem:

- Executive Summary
  - Impact
  - Root cause
- Impact
  - Number of impacted users
  - Lost revenue
  - Duration
  - Team impact
- Timeline
  - Detection
  - Resolution
- Root cause analysis
  - E.g. with 5 whys method
- Lessons learned
  - Things that went well
  - Things that went poorly
- Action items (include direct links to task tracking tool)

  - Cloze deletion is easy and effective: Kaleida's mission was to create a ... It finally produced one, called Script X. But it took three years
  - Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion
  - Avoid sets
  - Avoid enumerations
  - Combat interference - even the simplest items can be completely intractable if they are similar to other items. Use examples, context cues, vivid illustrations, refer to emotions, and to your personal life
  - Personalize and provide examples - personalization might be the most effective way of building upon other memories. Your personal life is a gold mine of facts and events to refer to. As long as you build a collection for yourself, use personalization richly to build upon well established memories
  - Provide sources - sources help you manage the learning process, updating your knowledge, judging its reliability, or importance

Richard Feynman's Learning Strategy:

1. Step 1: Continually ask "Why?‚Äù
2. Step 2: When you learn something, learn it to where you can explain it to a child.
3. Step 3: Instead of arbitrarily memorizing things, look for the explanation that makes it obvious.

### Observability (monitoring, logging, exception handling)

_See also: [Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)](#site-reliability-engineering-sre)_

#### Logging

- [Do not log](https://sobolevn.me/2020/03/do-not-log) dwells on some logging antipatterns.
  - Logging does not make much sense in monitoring and error tracking. Use better tools instead: error and business monitorings with alerts, versioning, event sourcing.
  - Logging adds significant complexity to your architecture. And it requires more testing. Use architecture patterns that will make logging an explicit part of your contracts
  - Logging is a whole infrastructure subsystem on its own. And quite a complex one. You will have to maintain it or to outsource this job to existing logging services
- [Lies My Parents Told Me (About Logs)](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/lies-my-parents-told-me-about-logs/)
  - Logs are cheap
  - I can run it better myself
  - Leveled logging is a great way to separate information
  - Logs are basically the same as events
  - A standard logging format is good enough

#### Metrics

- [Meaningful availability](https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/02/26/meaningful-availability/)
  - A good availability metric should be meaningful, proportional, and actionable. By "meaningful" we mean that it should capture what users experience. By "proportional" we mean that a change in the metric should be proportional to the change in user-perceived availability. By "actionable" we mean that the metric should give system owners insight into why availability for a period was low. This paper shows that none of the commonly used metrics satisfy these requirements‚Ä¶

  - Your typical architecture astronaut will take a fact like ‚ÄúNapster is a peer-to-peer service for downloading music‚Äù and ignore everything but the architecture, thinking it‚Äôs interesting because it‚Äôs peer to peer, completely missing the point that it‚Äôs interesting because you can type the name of a song and listen to it right away.

### Programming languages

I would recommend learning:

- JavaScript and maybe another interpreted language (Python, Ruby, etc.). Interpreted languages are useful for quick one-off automation scripts, and fastest to write for interviews. JavaScript is ubiquitous.
- A compiled language (Java, C, C++...).
  - [Learn c in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c/)
- A more recent language to see where the industry is going (as of writing, Go, Swift, Rust, Elixir...).
- A language that has first-class support for functional programming (Haskell, Scala, Clojure...).

### Refactoring

- [The Rule of Three](https://blog.codinghorror.com/rule-of-three/), Coding Horror
  - Every programmer ever born thinks whatever idea just popped out of their head into their editor is the most generalized, most flexible, most one-size-fits all solution that has ever been conceived.
  - It is three times as difficult to build reusable components as single use components.
  - A reusable component should be tried out in three different applications before it will be sufficiently general to accept into a reuse library.

  - Deliver new functionality to users rapidly but safely
  - Release Toggles allow incomplete and un-tested codepaths to be shipped to production as latent code which may never be turned on.
  - Experiment Toggles are used to perform multivariate or A/B testing.
  - Ops Toggles control operational aspects of our system's behavior.
  - Permissioning Toggles change the features or product experience that certain users receive.
  - Static vs dynamic toggles
  - Long-lived toggles vs transient toggles
  - Savvy teams view their Feature Toggles as inventory which comes with a carrying cost, and work to keep that inventory as low as possible.

  - Complex systems have emergent behavior, producing epiphenomenon that only appears with sufficient scale.
  - Wood's theorem: As the complexity of a system increases, the accuracy of any single agent‚Äôs own model of that system decreases rapidly.
  - The more tools and code that you add to create elements in a system, the harder it is to replicate an environment encompassing those tools and code.
  - At the core of testing in production is the idea of splitting deployments (of artifacts) from releases (of features).
- [Testing in Production: the hard parts](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/testing-in-production-the-hard-parts-3f06cefaf592), Cindy Sridharan
  - The whole point of [actual] distributed systems engineering is you assume you‚Äôre going to fail at some point in time and you design the system in such a way that the damage, at each point is minimized, that recovery is quick, and that the risk is acceptably balanced with cost.
  - How can you cut the blast radius for a similar event in half?
    - Differentiate between deployment (0 risk) and release
    - Build a deploy-observe-release pipeline
    - Make incremental rollouts the norm (canaries, %-based rollouts, etc.)
    - Test configuration changes just like you test code
    - Default to roll back, avoid fixing forward (slow!)
    - Eliminate gray failures - prefer crashing to degrading in certain cases
    - Prefer loosely coupled services at the expense of latency or correctness
    - Use poison tasters (isolate handling of client input)
    - Implement per-request-class backpressure
    - Have proper visibility from a client/end-user standpoint (client-side metrics)

- üß∞ [Testing Distributed Systems](https://asatarin.github.io/testing-distributed-systems/)

Why test:

- [Why bother writing tests at all?](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/14/why-bother-writing-tests-at-all), Dave Cheney. A good intro to the topic.
  - Even if you don‚Äôt, someone will test your software
  - The majority of testing should be performed by development teams
  - Manual testing should not be the majority of your testing because manual testing is O(n)
  - Tests are the critical component that ensure you can always ship your master branch
  - Tests lock in behaviour
  - Tests give you confidence to change someone else‚Äôs code

How to test:

- [A quick puzzle to test your problem solving](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/03/upshot/a-quick-puzzle-to-test-your-problem-solving.html?_r=0)... and a great way to learn about confirmation bias and why you're mostly writing positive test cases.

- [The practical test pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html), MartinFowler.com
  - Be clear about the different types of tests that you want to write. Agree on the naming in your team and find consensus on the scope of each type of test.
  - Every single test in your test suite is additional baggage and doesn't come for free.
  - Test code is as important as production code.

  - A URI is a string of characters that identifies a resource. Its syntax is `<scheme>:<authority><path>?<query>#<fragment>`, where only `<scheme>` and `<path>` are mandatory. URL and URN are URIs.
  - A URL is a string of characters that identifies a resource located on a computer network. Its syntax depends on its scheme. E.g. `mailto:billg@microsoft.com`.
  - A URN is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a resource. Its syntax is `urn:<namespace identifier>:<namespace specific string>`. E.g. `urn:isbn:9780062301239`

  - If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
  - Never use the passive where you can use the active.
  - Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
