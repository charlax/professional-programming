# Professional Programming - about this list

> Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. (Abraham Lincoln)

A collection of full-stack resources for programmers.

The goal of this page is to make you a more proficient developer. You'll find only resources that I've found truly inspiring, or that have become timeless classics.

This page is not meant to be comprehensive. I am trying to keep it light and not too overwhelming. The selection of articles is opinionated.

Items:

- üß∞ : list of resources
- üìñ : book
- üéû : video/movie extract/movie/talk
- üèô : slides/presentation
- ‚≠êÔ∏è : must-read

## Contributing to this list

Feel free to open a PR to contribute! I will not be adding everything: as stated above, I am trying to keep the list concise.

## Must-read books

I've found these books incredibly inspiring:

- üìñ [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to
  Master](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/): hands-on the most inspiring and useful book I've read about programming.
- üìñ [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software
  Construction](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670): a nice addition to The Pragmatic Programmer, gives you the necessary framework to talk about code.
- üìñ [Release It!](https://smile.amazon.com/Release-Design-Deploy-Production-Ready-Software/dp/1680502395): this books goes beyond code and gives you best practices for building production-ready software. It will give you about 3 years worth of real-world experience.
- üìñ [Scalability Rules: 50 Principles for Scaling Web Sites](https://smile.amazon.com/Scalability-Rules-Principles-Scaling-Sites/dp/013443160X)
- üìñ [The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/The-Linux-Programming-Interface-Handbook/dp/1593272200): outside of teaching you almost everything you need to know about Linux, this book will give you insights into how software evolves, and the value of having simple & elegant interfaces.
- üìñ [Structure and interpretation of Computer Programs](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) (free): One of the most influential textbooks in Computer Science (written and used at MIT), SICP has been influential in CS education. [Byte](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)>) recommended SICP "for professional programmers who are really interested in their profession".

There are some free books available, including:

- üìñ [Professional software development](http://mixmastamyk.bitbucket.io/pro_soft_dev/): pretty complete and a good companion to this page. The free chapters are mostly focused on software development processes: design, testing, code writing, etc. - and not so much about tech itself.
- üß∞ [vhf/free-programming-books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books)
- üß∞ [EbookFoundation/free-programming-books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books.md)

- [Things I Learnt The Hard Way](https://blog.juliobiason.me/thoughts/things-i-learnt-the-hard-way/)
  - Spec first, then code
  - Tests make better APIs
  - Future thinking is future trashing
  - Documentation is a love letter to your future self

- [Signs that you're a bad programmer](http://www.yacoset.com/Home/signs-that-you-re-a-bad-programmer)
- [7 absolute truths I unlearned as junior developer](https://monicalent.com/blog/2019/06/03/absolute-truths-unlearned-as-junior-developer/)
  - Early in your career, you can learn 10x more in a supportive team in 1 year, than coding on your own
  - Every company has problems, every company has technical debt.
  - Being overly opinionated on topics you lack real-world experience with is pretty arrogant.
  - Many conference talks cover proof of concepts rather than real-world scenarios.
  - Dealing with legacy is completely normal.
  - Architecture is more important than nitpicking.
  - Focus on automation over documentation where appropriate.
  - Having some technical debt is healthy.
  - Senior engineers must develop many skills besides programming.
  - We‚Äôre all still junior in some areas.
- [How to Build Good Software](https://www.csc.gov.sg/articles/how-to-build-good-software)
  - A good high-level summary of fundamental engineering practices.
  - The root cause of bad software has less to do with specific engineering choices, and more to do with how development projects are managed.
  - There is no such thing as platonically good engineering: it depends on your needs and the practical problems you encounter.
  - Software should be treated not as a static product, but as a living manifestation of the development team‚Äôs collective understanding.
  - Software projects rarely fail because they are too small; they fail because they get too big.
  - Beware of bureaucratic goals masquerading as problem statements. If our end goal is to make citizens‚Äô lives better, we need to explicitly acknowledge the things that are making their lives worse.
  - Building software is not about avoiding failure; it is about strategically failing as fast as possible to get the information you need to build something good.

List of axioms:

- [Precepts - Urbit](https://urbit.org/blog/precepts/)
  - Data is better than code.
  - Correctness is more important than performance.
  - Deterministic beats heuristic.
  - One hundred lines of simplicity is better than twenty lines of complexity.
  - If your abstractions are leaking, it's not due to some law of the universe; you just suck at abstracting. Usually, you didn't specify the abstraction narrowly enough.
  - If you avoid changing a section of code for fear of awakening the demons therein, you are living in fear. If you stay in the comfortable confines of the small section of the code you wrote or know well, you will never write legendary code. All code was written by humans and can be mastered by humans.
  - If there's clearly a right way to do something and a wrong way, do it the right way. Coding requires incredible discipline.
  - The best way to get the right answer is to try it the wrong way.
  - Practice tells you that things are good or bad; theory tells you why.
  - Not being qualified to solve a problem is no reason not to solve it.
  - If you don't understand a system you're using, you don't control it. If nobody understands the system, the system is in control.

## Topics

### Algorithm and data structures

- Read the [CLRS](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms). You can watch and download the course on [OCW](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/) - there are newer courses as well.
- Or [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202?ie=UTF8&qid=1297127794&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1)
- Try out some algorithms on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

Other resources:

- [Algorithms](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/), Jeff Erickson

Let's be honest: algorithms can be a pretty dry topic. [This quora question](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-book-that-teaches-algorithms-data-structures-and-other-computer-science-basics-in-a-fun-way) lists some funnier learning alternative, including:

- [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617292230/ref=cm_sw_su_dp)

  - In the triumvirate of software, product managers, designers, and software engineers, only the engineers are expected to turn off their creative minds and just produce.
  - Both engineers and product managers tend to think, incorrectly, that product specifications or requirements are equivalent to the furniture manual from Ikea.
  - This is one of the top things that make engineers grumpy: constantly shifting priorities.
  - Even though many engineers will complain that product managers change their minds, almost none will account for that in their time estimates.
  - Computer science programs aren‚Äôt about preparing you for the tasks you‚Äôll face in industry.
  - When there are more engineers than can be used, engineering time ends up going away from developing and towards planning, synchronization, and coordination.
  - Involve engineers in the creative process
  - Give engineers opportunities to be creative.
  - Encourage time off.
  - Let 'em code
  - Express appreciation
- [The Product-Minded Software Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/), Gergely Orosz
  - Great product engineers know that minimum lovable products need the right depth

  - Engage in user research and customer support
  - Bring well-backed product suggestions to the table
  - Offer product/engineering tradeoffs
- [40 Lessons From 40 Years](https://medium.com/@schlaf/40-lessons-from-40-years-de39d2c622d6), Steve Schlafman
  - If you want to make progress on the things that matter most, you need to decide who you‚Äôre going to disappoint. It‚Äôs inevitable.
  - The best investment you can make is your own education. Never stop learning. The second best investment you can make is building your network through authentic and meaningful interactions. It is what you know and who you know.
  - You‚Äôll never get what you don‚Äôt ask for or actively seek out. Go for it!
  - It‚Äôs not about the light at the end of the tunnel. It‚Äôs the tunnel. Show up every day and enjoy the process.
  - A great teammate always puts the organization and its purpose ahead of their own self interests.
  - Pick your spots. We have limited time and our brains can only process so much. Focus is key. Choose wisely.
  - Every person is likely struggling with something. Be kind. Be helpful.
- [On Coding, Ego and Attention](https://josebrowne.com/on-coding-ego-and-attention/)
  - Beginner‚Äôs mind accepts the fact that absolute knowledge is infinite and thus keeping score is a waste of time.
  - Mastery is simply the accumulation of momentum, not the accumulation of knowledge.
  - Dealing with ego distraction has taught me to love the problem solving process. It‚Äôs taught me to love and respect the learning process. As a result I‚Äôm more productive. I‚Äôm less anxious. I‚Äôm a better teammate. I‚Äôm a better friend and a better thinker.

> Imposter syndrome is underrated: a lot of talk goes into overcoming imposter syndrome. I say embrace self-skepticism and doubt yourself every day. In a fast-moving industry where lots of your knowledge expires every year, even the most junior people around you constantly cook up skills you don't have; you stay competitive by applying with the determination (and even fear) of the novice. The upside of this treadmill is that every engineer is on it: just because you're an imposter doesn't mean that other people are more deserving than you, because they're imposters too. You should advocate for yourself, take risks, pat yourself on the back when things go well, and, as you start to build a track record of solving problems, trust your skills and adaptability. Just make no mistake: you're only as good as the last problem you solve.

### Design (visual, UX, UI, typography)

I highly recommend reading [The Non-Designer's Design Book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0133966151/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687602&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0321534042&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1R7MVQP0BCP7GP9VZGYX). This is a pretty short book that will give you some very actionable design advices.

- If you're working on data, Edward Tufte's [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458046603&sr=8-1&keywords=tufte) is considered a classic.
- The [Universal Principles of Design](http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458046663&sr=8-1&keywords=universal+principles+of+design) will give you enough vocabulary and concepts to describe design challenges into words.

### Design (OO modeling, architecture, patterns, anti-patterns, etc.)

Here's a list of good books:

- üìñ [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201633612/): dubbed "the gang of four", this is almost a required reading for any developer. A lot of those are a bit overkill for Python (because everything is an object, and dynamic typing), but the main idea (composition is better than inheritance) definitely is a good philosophy.
- üìñ [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321127420/?tag=stackoverfl08-20): learn about how database are used in real world applications. Mike Bayer's SQLAlchemy has been heavily influenced by this book.

- üìñ [Clean Architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18043011-clean-architecture), Robert C. Martin. Uncle Bob proposes an architecture that leverages the Single Responsibility Principle to its fullest. A great way to start a new codebase. Also checkout the [clean architecture cheatsheet](cheatsheets/Clean-Architecture-V1.0.pdf) and [this article](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
- üìñ [Game Programming Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0990582906/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_9xygFb9M86CXY): a book about design, sequencing, behavioral patterns and much more by Robert Nystrom explained through the medium of game programming.

- [OO vs FP](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/11/24/FPvsOO.html), Robert C. Martin, The Clean Code Blog. A pretty interesting take on the differences between OOP and FP from an expert in OOP.
  - OO is not about state. Objects are bags of functions, not bags of data.
  - Functional Programs, like OO Programs, are composed of functions that operate on data.
  - FP imposes discipline upon assignment.
  - OO imposes discipline on function pointers.
  - The principles of software design still apply, regardless of your programming style. The fact that you‚Äôve decided to use a language that doesn‚Äôt have an assignment operator does not mean that you can ignore the Single Responsibility Principle.
- [Parse, don‚Äôt validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)
  - Use a data structure that makes illegal states unrepresentable
  - Push the burden of proof upward as far as possible, but no further
  - Let your datatypes inform your code, don‚Äôt let your code control your datatypes
  - Don‚Äôt be afraid to parse data in multiple passes
  - Avoid denormalized representations of data, especially if it‚Äôs mutable
  - Use abstract datatypes to make validators ‚Äúlook like‚Äù parsers

### Incident response (oncall, alerting, outages, firefighting, postmortem)

- [Incident Response at Heroku](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/5/9/incident-response-at-heroku)
- [My Philosophy On Alerting](https://linuxczar.net/sysadmin/philosophy-on-alerting/)
  - Pages should be urgent, important, actionable, and real.
  - Err on the side of removing noisy alerts ‚Äì over-monitoring is a harder problem to solve than under-monitoring.
  - Symptoms are a better way to capture more problems more comprehensively and robustly with less effort.
  - Include cause-based information in symptom-based pages or on dashboards, but avoid alerting directly on causes.
  - The further up your serving stack you go, the more distinct problems you catch in a single rule. But don‚Äôt go so far you can‚Äôt sufficiently distinguish what‚Äôs going on.
  - If you want a quiet oncall rotation, it‚Äôs imperative to have a system for dealing with things that need timely response, but are not imminently critical.
- The Google SRE book's [chapter about oncall](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/on-call/)
- [Writing Runbook Documentation When You‚Äôre An SRE](https://www.transposit.com/blog/2020.01.30-writing-runbook-documentation-when-youre-an-sre/)
  - Playbooks ‚Äúreduce stress, the mean time to repair (MTTR), and the risk of human error.‚Äù
  - Using a template can be beneficial because starting from a blank document is incredibly hard.
  - The Curse of Knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when someone is communicating with others and unknowingly assumes the level of knowledge of the people they are communicating with.
  - Make your content easy to glance over.
  - If a script is longer than a single line, treat it like code, and check it into a repository to be source control and potentially tested.
- [Incident Review and Postmortem Best Practices](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/incident-review-best-practices?s=r), Gergely Orosz

#### Postmortem

- A great example of a [postmortem from Gitlab (01/31/2017)](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/) for an outage during which an engineer's action caused the irremediable loss of 6 hours of data.
- [Blameless PostMortems and a Just Culture](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/)
- [A list of postmortems on Github](https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems)
- Google's SRE book, [Postmortem chapter](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/postmortem-culture/) is excellent and includes many examples.

> "Let‚Äôs plan for a future where we‚Äôre all as stupid as we are today."

  - "As a medium, books are surprisingly bad at conveying knowledge, and readers mostly don‚Äôt realize it."
  - "In learning sciences, we call this model ‚Äútransmissionism.‚Äù It‚Äôs the notion that knowledge can be directly transmitted from teacher to student, like transcribing text from one page onto another. If only!"
  - "By re-testing yourself on material you‚Äôve learned over expanding intervals, you can cheaply and reliably commit huge volumes of information to long-term memory."

  - Add images. Our brains are wired visually, so this helps retention.
  - Don't add things you don't understand.
  - Don't add cards memorizing entire lists.
  - Write it out. For wrong answers, I'll write it on paper. The act of writing is meditative. I really enjoy this.
  - Keep on asking yourself why? why does this work? why does it work this way? Force yourself to understand the root of a topic.
  - Cornell Method: when reading a topic, write out questions on the margins to quiz yourself.
  - Pretend you have to teach it

- [Effective learning: Twenty rules of formulating knowledge](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules)
  - Build upon the basics
  - Stick to the minimum information principle: the material you learn must be formulated in as simple way as it is
  - Cloze deletion is easy and effective: Kaleida's mission was to create a ... It finally produced one, called Script X. But it took three years
  - Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion
  - Avoid sets
  - Avoid enumerations
  - Combat interference - even the simplest items can be completely intractable if they are similar to other items. Use examples, context cues, vivid illustrations, refer to emotions, and to your personal life
  - Personalize and provide examples - personalization might be the most effective way of building upon other memories. Your personal life is a gold mine of facts and events to refer to. As long as you build a collection for yourself, use personalization richly to build upon well established memories
  - Provide sources - sources help you manage the learning process, updating your knowledge, judging its reliability, or importance
  - Prioritize - effective learning is all about prioritizing.

Richard Feynman's Learning Strategy:

1. Step 1: Continually ask "Why?‚Äù
2. Step 2: When you learn something, learn it to where you can explain it to a child.
3. Step 3: Instead of arbitrarily memorizing things, look for the explanation that makes it obvious.

  - A URI is a string of characters that identifies a resource. Its syntax is `<scheme>:<authority><path>?<query>#<fragment>`, where only `<scheme>` and `<path>` are mandatory. URL and URN are URIs.
  - A URL is a string of characters that identifies a resource located on a computer network. Its syntax depends on its scheme. E.g. `mailto:billg@microsoft.com`.
  - A URN is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a resource. Its syntax is `urn:<namespace identifier>:<namespace specific string>`. E.g. `urn:isbn:9780062301239`

### Observability (monitoring, logging, exception handling)

#### Logging

- [Do not log](https://sobolevn.me/2020/03/do-not-log) dwells on some logging antipatterns.
  - Logging does not make much sense in monitoring and error tracking. Use better tools instead: error and business monitorings with alerts, versioning, event sourcing.
  - Logging adds significant complexity to your architecture. And it requires more testing. Use architecture patterns that will make logging an explicit part of your contracts
  - Logging is a whole infrastructure subsystem on its own. And quite a complex one. You will have to maintain it or to outsource this job to existing logging services
- [Lies My Parents Told Me (About Logs)](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/lies-my-parents-told-me-about-logs/)
    - Logs are cheap
    - I can run it better myself
    - Leveled logging is a great way to separate information
    - Logs are basically the same as events
    - A standard logging format is good enough

    - You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time.
    - Measure
    - Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small.
    - Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones
    - Data dominates.
- [Performance comparison: counting words in Python, Go, C++, C, AWK, Forth, and Rust](https://benhoyt.com/writings/count-words/): a great way to learn about measuring performance.

### Personal productivity

Check out this section on my [list of management resources, "Personal productivity"](https://github.com/charlax/engineering-management/#personal-productivity).

### Perspective

- [At 31, I have just weeks to live. Here's what I want to pass on](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/07/terminal-cancer-live-cancer-life-death)
  - First, the importance of gratitude.
  - Second, a life, if lived well, is long enough.
  - Third, it‚Äôs important to let yourself be vulnerable and connect to others.
  - Fourth, do something for others.
  - Fifth, protect the planet.

    - Define the problem - what is it that you're trying to achieve?
    - Invert it - what would guarantee the failure to achieve this outcome?
    - Finally, consider solutions to avoid this failure

### Project management

See the [Project management section on my engineering-management list of resources](https://github.com/charlax/engineering-management#project-management).

### Programming languages

I would recommend learning:

- JavaScript and maybe another interpreted language (Python, Ruby, etc.). Interpreted languages are useful for quick one-off automation scripts, and fastest to write for interviews. JavaScript is ubiquitous.
- A compiled language (Java, C, C++...).
  - [Learn c in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c/)
- A more recent language to see where the industry is going (as of writing, Go, Swift, Rust, Elixir...).
- A language that has first-class support for functional programming (Haskell, Scala, Clojure...).

-- Bjarne Stroustrup (C++ creator)

#### Python

For Python feel free to checkout my [professional Python education repository](https://github.com/charlax/python-education).

#### JavaScript

JavaScript is such a pervasive language that it's almost required learning.

### Programming paradigm

- [Imperative vs Declarative Programming](https://tylermcginnis.com/imperative-vs-declarative-programming/), Tyler McGinnis.
    - I draw the line between declarative and non-declarative at whether you can trace the code as it runs. Regex is 100% declarative, as it‚Äôs untraceable while the pattern is being executed.

### Refactoring

- [The Rule of Three](https://blog.codinghorror.com/rule-of-three/), Coding Horror
  - Every programmer ever born thinks whatever idea just popped out of their head into their editor is the most generalized, most flexible, most one-size-fits all solution that has ever been conceived.
  - It is three times as difficult to build reusable components as single use components.
  - A reusable component should be tried out in three different applications before it will be sufficiently general to accept into a reuse library.

- [Feature Toggles (aka Feature Flags)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html), Pete Hodgson, martinFowler.com. Comprehensive article on the topic.
  - Deliver new functionality to users rapidly but safely
  - Release Toggles allow incomplete and un-tested codepaths to be shipped to production as latent code which may never be turned on.
  - Experiment Toggles are used to perform multivariate or A/B testing.
  - Ops Toggles control operational aspects of our system's behavior.
  - Permissioning Toggles change the features or product experience that certain users receive.
  - Static vs dynamic toggles
  - Long-lived toggles vs transient toggles
  - Savvy teams view their Feature Toggles as inventory which comes with a carrying cost, and work to keep that inventory as low as possible.

- [Developing in Production](https://tersesystems.com/blog/2020/01/22/developing-in-production/)
  - Complex systems have emergent behavior, producing epiphenomenon that only appears with sufficient scale.
  - Wood's theorem: As the complexity of a system increases, the accuracy of any single agent‚Äôs own model of that system decreases rapidly.
  - The more tools and code that you add to create elements in a system, the harder it is to replicate an environment encompassing those tools and code.
  - At the core of testing in production is the idea of splitting deployments (of artifacts) from releases (of features).
- [Testing in Production: the hard parts](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/testing-in-production-the-hard-parts-3f06cefaf592), Cindy Sridharan
  - The whole point of [actual] distributed systems engineering is you assume you‚Äôre going to fail at some point in time and you design the system in such a way that the damage, at each point is minimized, that recovery is quick, and that the risk is acceptably balanced with cost.
  - How can you cut the blast radius for a similar event in half?
    - Differentiate between deployment (0 risk) and release
    - Build a deploy-observe-release pipeline
    - Make incremental rollouts the norm (canaries, %-based rollouts, etc.)
    - Test configuration changes just like you test code
    - Default to roll back, avoid fixing forward (slow!)
    - Eliminate gray failures - prefer crashing to degrading in certain cases
    - Prefer loosely coupled services at the expense of latency or correctness
    - Use poison tasters (isolate handling of client input)
    - Implement per-request-class backpressure
    - Have proper visibility from a client/end-user standpoint (client-side metrics)

  - External input needs to be validated before it is used in the system, in the following order: origin, size, lexical content, syntax, semantics.
  - Entities should be consistent at creation, have limited operation, shouldn't be sharing mutable objects.
  - Three Rs to do every few hours: rotate secrets automatically, repave servers and applications (redeploy on clean footprint), repair vulnerable.
  - Don‚Äôt use exceptions for the control flow.

By "proportional" we mean that a change in the metric should be proportional to the change in user-perceived availability. By "actionable" we mean that the metric should give system owners insight into why availability for a period was low.

- [Ur-Technical Debt](https://www.georgefairbanks.com/ieee-software-v32-n4-july-2020-ur-technical-debt)
    - Today, any code that a developer dislikes is branded as technical debt.
    - Ward Cunningham invented the debt metaphor to explain to his manager that building iteratively gave them working code faster, much like borrowing money to start a project, but that it was essential to keep paying down the debt, otherwise the interest payments would grind the project to a halt.
    - Ur-technical debt is generally not detectable by static analysis.

### Testing

- ‚≠êÔ∏è [Testing strategies in a microservices architecture](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/) (Martin Fowler) is an awesome resources explaining how to test a service properly.

Why test:

- [Why bother writing tests at all?](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/14/why-bother-writing-tests-at-all), Dave Cheney. A good intro to the topic.
  - Even if you don‚Äôt, someone will test your software
  - The majority of testing should be performed by development teams
  - Manual testing should not be the majority of your testing because manual testing is O(n)
  - Tests are the critical component that ensure you can always ship your master branch
  - Tests lock in behaviour
  - Tests give you confidence to change someone else‚Äôs code

How to test:

- [A quick puzzle to test your problem solving](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/03/upshot/a-quick-puzzle-to-test-your-problem-solving.html?_r=0)... and a great way to learn about confirmation bias and why you're mostly writing positive test cases.
- [Testing is not for beginners](https://www.calhoun.io/testing-is-not-for-beginners/): why learning to test is hard. This shouldn't demotivate you though!
- [Arrange-act-assert: a pattern for writing good tests](https://automationpanda.com/2020/07/07/arrange-act-assert-a-pattern-for-writing-good-tests/)
- [Test smarter, not¬†harder](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/test-smarter-not-harder/)

Test pyramid:

- [The test pyramid](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html), Martin Fowler
- [Eradicating non-determinism in tests](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/nonDeterminism.html), Martin Fowler
- [The practical test pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html), MartinFowler.com
  - Be clear about the different types of tests that you want to write. Agree on the naming in your team and find consensus on the scope of each type of test.
  - Every single test in your test suite is additional baggage and doesn't come for free.

  - Research shows that it takes as long as 30 minutes for makers to get into the flow
  - Use maker-manager office hours
  - Communication can happen at a quieter asynchronous frequency in the form of thoughtful, written discussions rather than soul-sucking meetings or erratic one-line-at-a-time chat messages

- [100 Tips for a Better Life](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7hFeMWC6Y5eaSixbD/100-tips-for-a-better-life)
    - Deficiencies do not make you special. The older you get, the more your inability to cook will be a red flag for people.
    - History remembers those who got to market first. Getting your creation out into the world is more important than getting it perfect.
    - Discipline is superior to motivation. The former can be trained, the latter is fleeting. You won‚Äôt be able to accomplish great things if you‚Äôre only relying on motivation.
    - You do not live in a video game. There are no pop-up warnings if you‚Äôre about to do something foolish, or if you‚Äôve been going in the wrong direction for too long. You have to create your own warnings.
    - Cultivate a reputation for being dependable. Good reputations are valuable because they‚Äôre rare (easily destroyed and hard to rebuild). You don‚Äôt have to brew the most amazing coffee if your customers know the coffee will always be hot.
    - Compliment people more. Many people have trouble thinking of themselves as smart, or pretty, or kind, unless told by someone else. You can help them out.

My experience has been that it is easier to educate a Do-er than to motivate the educated; you have to believe you can Do before you embark on an effort. ‚Äì John Carmack

    - From the HN discussion: "Writing a couple of pages of design docs or an Amazon-style 6 pager or whatever might take a few days of work, but can save weeks or more of wasted implementation time when you realise your system design was flawed or it doesn't address any real user needs."

  - Powerpoint-style presentations somehow give permission to gloss over ideas, flatten out any sense of relative importance, and ignore the interconnectedness of ideas.
