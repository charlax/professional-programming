Database anti-patterns
======================

Using `VARCHAR` instead of `TEXT` (PostgreSQL)
----------------------------------------------

Unless you absolutely restrict the width of a text column for data consistency
reason, don't do it.

This
[benchmark](http://www.depesz.com/2010/03/02/charx-vs-varcharx-vs-varchar-vs-text/)
shows that there's fundamentally no difference in performance between
`char(n)`, `varchar(n)`, `varchar` and `text`. Here's why you should pick
`text`:

* `char(n)`: takes more space than necessary when dealing with values shorter
  than n.
* `varchar(n)`: it's difficult to change the width.
* `varchar` is just like `text`.
* `text` does not have the width problem that `char(n)` and `varchar(n)` and
  has a cleaner name than `varchar`.
